    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Democratic control, profits shared among members.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Decision-making can be slow.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Indian Coffee Houses operated as cooperatives in various cities.</p>

    <h3>Franchise</h3>
    <p>A business where individuals buy the rights to operate under an established brand and business model.</p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Known brand, support from the franchisor.</p>
